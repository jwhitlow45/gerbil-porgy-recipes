# salsa roja

_burning the shit out of peppers and then putting them in a blender_

## equipment

oven

wire rack - optional

sheet pan

blender

## ingredients

**NOTE: buy your produce from a small produce market, they tend to have better peppers than any large grocery store you can name**

### produce

vine ripened tomatoes, medium - 5 to 7

jalapenos - 4

serranos - 4

poblanos - 3

green onion - 1 cup

cilantro - 1 cup, stems included

garlic - 4 cloves

### cans

diced tomatoes - 14 oz

### liquids

olive oil

lime juice - 120 ml

### spices

salt

## prep

### wash

wash with water

- vine ripened tomatoes, medium - 5 to 7
- jalapenos - 4
- serranos - 4
- poblanos - 3
- green onion - 1 cup
- cilantro, stems included - 1 cup

### knife

remove stems, leave in seeds and pith

- vine ripened tomatoes, medium - 5 to 7
- jalapenos - 4
- serranos - 4
- poblanos - 3

chop, dice, and mince respectively, and set aside

- green onion - 1 cup
- cilantro, stems included - 1 cup
- garlic - 4 cloves

### season

arrange onto wire rack or sheet tray

- vine ripened tomatoes, medium - 5 to 7
- jalapenos - 4
- serranos - 4
- poblanos - 3

coat above in olive oil

coat above in layer of salt, going for visible coating all over without absorbing all of the oil, similar to a well-salted steak

## cook

place wire rack into oven over sheet tray, omit if using sheet tray

roast at 450F (20 minutes), or as hot as your oven will go, goal is to burn everything

## blend

while peppers are roasting, add the following, in order, to blender

- green onion - 1 cup
- cilantro, stems included - 1 cup
- garlic - 4 cloves
- diced tomatoes - 14 oz
- lime juice - 120 ml

let sit to allow lime juice to react with diced tomatoes

once peppers are done roasting, add roasted tomatoes and peppers to blender

for smoother salsa, blend on high until everything is well incorporated

for chunkier salsa, blend using pulse function until desired texture is reached

## finish

transfer to a large bowl

add salt to taste until it is slightly too salty, it will take more than you think

add lime juice to taste until salsa no longer tastes too salty, we are neutralizing the salt flavor using lime juice, over-salting in previous step saves us chasing a moving target by alternating between adding lime juice and salt

**NOTE: taste test with whatever chips the salsa will be served with to accommodate for salt in chips**

## extras

this recipe should be treated as a base recipe to branch off of, not gospel

play around with different peppers, as you get more comfortable making salsa you will learn how different flavors from different peppers interact and no longer need a recipe

one of the most important things when making salsa is the pepper to tomato ratio which keeps things balanced, this recipe is slightly pepper heavy, but you could double the peppers and it would still be within range, albeit very spicy
